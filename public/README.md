## Hero Image Setup

To display the MainSt.AI hero image on the home page:

1. Save the hero image (the one with the worker in blue uniform and yellow hard hat) as `mainst-hero.jpg` in this folder
2. The image should show:
   - MainSt.AI branding
   - "We are here to stay" text
   - "USA" text
   - "New Era" text
   - Worker in blue uniform with yellow hard hat

**File location:** `/public/mainst-hero.jpg`

The image will automatically be displayed on the Home page as the hero background.

If you don't have the image yet, the Home page will still work - it will just show a dark background without the image.
